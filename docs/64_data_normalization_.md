# Chapter 64: Data Normalization

Welcome back! In the [previous chapter](63_validation_framework_.md), we explored the **Validation Framework**, our system for checking input data quality and consistency. It ensures we don't run algorithms with missing fields, incorrect formats, or logical errors like end dates before start dates.

But even if data *formats* are correct, we can still have inconsistencies in the *values* themselves. Think about product attributes like color or brand. What happens if:
*   One input file lists a color as "BLUE"?
*   Another file lists it as "Blue"?
*   A third file lists it as "blue"?
*   And maybe someone accidentally typed " blue  " with extra spaces?

To the computer, these are four *different* strings. If we try to group products by color later, we might end up with four separate groups instead of one "Blue" group, leading to incorrect analysis and planning. This could mean we miscalculate how popular the color blue really is!

## What Problem Does Data Normalization Solve?

Imagine organizing a music library where different albums list the same artist slightly differently: "The Beatles", "Beatles, The", "beatles". If you sort by artist, they won't group together properly! You need a consistent way to represent the artist's name, perhaps always as "BEATLES, THE".

**Data Normalization** in `irisx-algo` solves this problem for key text-based data fields, especially attributes like brand names, colors, sizes, categories, etc. It provides a standard way to **clean up and standardize** these text values so that the same concept is always represented by the exact same string.

It tackles common issues like:
*   **Case Sensitivity:** Converts everything to a standard case (usually UPPERCASE). "Blue", "blue", and "BLUE" all become "BLUE".
*   **Extra Spaces:** Removes leading/trailing spaces and sometimes collapses multiple internal spaces. " Brand X " becomes "BRAND X".
*   **Special Characters:** Might remove or replace certain special characters that could cause issues (though the primary focus is usually case and spacing).

By applying these normalization rules consistently whenever text data is read or processed, we ensure that comparisons, groupings, and lookups work reliably. It guarantees that "BLUE" always matches "BLUE", preventing fragmentation of data and improving the accuracy of analysis.

## Core Idea: Standardizing Text Values

The core idea is simple: have a central function or utility that takes any input string (like a brand name or color) and transforms it into its standard, "normalized" form according to defined rules.

The primary rules usually are:
1.  Convert the entire string to **UPPERCASE**.
2.  **Trim** whitespace from the beginning and end.

This standardized string is then used throughout the system for comparisons, map keys, groupings, etc.

## How It's Used: Applying the Rules

Normalization isn't a standalone module you run like OTB or Distribution. It's a utility function that's applied automatically at various points in the data handling process:

1.  **During Data Loading/Preparation:** When input files (like product masters, attribute files) are read, the normalization function is often applied to specific text columns *before* the data is stored in memory (e.g., in the [Cache](05_cache_.md) or used by validation modules).
2.  **Before Comparisons/Lookups:** If comparing an input value (maybe from user input or another file) against stored data, both values should ideally be normalized first to ensure a correct match.

**Example:** Loading Product Attributes

Imagine reading product information from an input file where `color = " Royal Blue "` and `brand = " brand x "`.

```java
// Conceptual data loading step inside a module or data loader

// Raw values read from the input file
String rawColor = " Royal Blue ";
String rawBrand = " brand x ";

// Apply normalization using a utility class (e.g., Normalize)
String normalizedColor = Normalize.normalize(rawColor);
String normalizedBrand = Normalize.normalize(rawBrand);

System.out.println("Raw Color: '" + rawColor + "' -> Normalized: '" + normalizedColor + "'");
System.out.println("Raw Brand: '" + rawBrand + "' -> Normalized: '" + normalizedBrand + "'");

// Store the NORMALIZED values in data objects or the Cache
// e.g., styleRow.setColor(normalizedColor);
// e.g., styleRow.setBrand(normalizedBrand);
```
**Explanation & Expected Output:**
*   The raw values (`" Royal Blue "`, `" brand x "`) are read.
*   The `Normalize.normalize()` function is called for each.
*   This function applies the rules (uppercase, trim).
*   The resulting standardized values are stored for later use.

```
Raw Color: ' Royal Blue ' -> Normalized: 'ROYAL BLUE'
Raw Brand: ' brand x ' -> Normalized: 'BRAND X'
```
Now, if another part of the system encounters "royal blue" or " ROYAL BLUE", normalizing it will also result in "ROYAL BLUE", allowing for correct matching and grouping with the value we just stored.

## Under the Hood: The `Normalize` Utility

The logic for normalization is usually contained within a simple utility class, often called `Normalize` or similar, containing one or more static methods. This makes it easy to call from anywhere in the code without needing to create an object first.

**Code Dive (`Normalize.java` or similar utility):**

Here's a simplified look at what such a utility class might contain:

```java
// Example Path: src/main/java/com/increff/irisx/api/Normalize.java
package com.increff.irisx.api; // Example package

import com.google.common.base.CharMatcher; // Optional: From Google Guava library for advanced cleaning
import com.increff.irisx.util.StringUtil; // Assumed local utility for checking empty strings

public class Normalize {

    /**
     * Basic normalization: Trims whitespace and converts to uppercase.
     * Handles null input.
     *
     * @param s The input string.
     * @return The normalized string (uppercase, trimmed), or null if input was null.
     */
    public static String normalize(String s) {
        // If the input is null, return null
        if (s == null) {
            return null;
        }
        // 1. Trim whitespace from start and end
        // 2. Convert to UPPERCASE
        return s.trim().toUpperCase();
        // Note: Original code also removed quotes, which could be added:
        // return s.trim().toUpperCase().replaceAll("\"", "");
    }

    /**
     * Normalizes specifically for use as map keys or unique identifiers.
     * Removes extra internal spaces and converts to uppercase.
     * Returns null if input is effectively empty after normalization.
     * Requires Google Guava library.
     *
     * @param str The input string.
     * @return Normalized string suitable for keys, or null.
     */
    public static String normalizeStringForKey(String str) {
        // If null or empty initially, return null
        if (StringUtil.isNullOrEmpty(str)) {
            return null;
        }
        // Use Guava's CharMatcher:
        // - trimAndCollapseFrom: Removes leading/trailing whitespace AND
        //   replaces consecutive internal whitespace chars with a single space.
        String cleanedString = CharMatcher.whitespace().trimAndCollapseFrom(str, ' ');

        // If the string becomes empty after cleaning, return null
        if (StringUtil.isNullOrEmpty(cleanedString)) {
            return null;
        }
        // Convert to uppercase
        return cleanedString.toUpperCase();
    }

    // Potentially other normalization methods for specific cases, like removing accents etc.
}

/*
// Example helper utility (conceptual)
package com.increff.irisx.util;
public class StringUtil {
   public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(String s) {
       return s == null || s.trim().isEmpty();
   }
}
*/
```
**Explanation:**
*   The primary `normalize(String s)` method uses standard Java String methods: `trim()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace and `toUpperCase()` to convert the case. It also handles `null` input gracefully.
*   The `normalizeStringForKey` method provides stronger cleaning suitable for creating unique identifiers or map keys. It uses Google Guava's `CharMatcher` library to not only trim ends but also replace sequences of internal whitespace (like multiple spaces or tabs) with a single space. This ensures keys like `"BRAND  X"` and `"BRAND X"` both become `"BRAND X"`. It also returns `null` if the string becomes empty after this cleaning, which can be useful logic when creating map keys.

**Where is `Normalize.normalize()` called?**
You'll often find calls to `Normalize.normalize()` or similar methods inside:
*   The constructors or setter methods of [Row Input/Output Classes](09_row_input_output_classes_.md) when data is being read from files or databases.
*   Data loading modules *before* adding data to the [Cache](05_cache_.md) or internal databases (`ImDbService`).
*   [Validation Framework](63_validation_framework_.md) modules when comparing input values against expected sets or formats (like in `ValidationUtil.checkAndValidateInSet`).
*   Helper classes like [ObjectMaps](11_objectmaps_.md) when creating keys for maps that rely on string attributes.
*   Anywhere user input or external data needs to be compared against internal standardized data.

## Conclusion

**Data Normalization** is a simple but essential data hygiene practice used throughout `irisx-algo`, often implemented via a utility class like `Normalize`.

*   It ensures that key text-based values (like brands, categories, colors, sizes) are **standardized** into a consistent format, primarily by **trimming whitespace** and converting to **uppercase**.
*   Normalization is consistently applied during **data loading** and before **comparisons or lookups**.
*   This prevents errors caused by minor variations in input (case, spacing) and ensures accurate **grouping, filtering, and analysis** by guaranteeing that identical concepts are represented by identical strings.

By applying normalization consistently, the system maintains data integrity and ensures reliable processing throughout its various modules.

We've now covered many core concepts, from individual modules and utilities to how they are grouped and how data is validated and normalized. But how is the entire application *framework* itself configured? How does Spring know which database to connect to, or which implementation of a specific service to use?
